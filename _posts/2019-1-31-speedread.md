Expecting a post on [Machine Learning]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-29-learning-machine-learning %})? I'll post an update tomorrow. For now I Made a small thing, called speedreader!

Check it out here. [LINK](https://kagia.github.io/speedread/).

It's built on top of Typescript/React/MobX. It was super enjoyable to work with [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)! Managing state in React has never been this easy!
