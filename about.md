Hey, Stranger!

I am Benjamin Kagia, a ninja programmer in the city of Nairobi. I spend most of my time thinking about programming as an art. I work for a brilliant company called [Andela](https://www.andela.com){:target="_blank"}. However, all opinions on this blog are my own and not necessarily that of my employer.

I promise to keep this blog updated at least once a week. You can hold me to this; just visit the [issues page](https://github.com/kagia/kagia.github.io/issues){:target="_blank"} and raise an issue when I don't!

smile.
